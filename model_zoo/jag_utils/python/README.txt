sanity.py
  script to test that sample lists generated by build_trainer_lists.py
  contain unique indices.

  usage: sanity.py id_mapping_fn bar_fn t0_fn [t1_fn, ...]

partition_jag.py
  Partitions the 100M LBANN_OPTION_JAG set as follows:
  from 100M:
    set A = 10M random samples
    set B = remaining (90M)

  from set B:
    for j in range 0..9 :
      extract 256 sets (C_j_0, C_j_1, ..., c_j_255)

  Note: each C_j_i has ~90M / 256 samples
  Note: also permute the lines in the sample lists for the C sets
