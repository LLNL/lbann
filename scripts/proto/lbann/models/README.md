# Model zoo

This directory contains common and influential neural network
models. The models are implemented as `Module`s and each Python file
can be imported for use in other Python scripts. These networks can be
used as components within more complicated models.

_Note to developers_: This directory is reserved for very
well-established models (i.e. O(1000) citations) and any Python
scripts should be usable by external users. Experimental models
should be kept within the model_zoo directory in the base LBANN
directory.
