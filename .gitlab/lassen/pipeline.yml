# This is the testing pipeline for the Lassen cluster at LLNL. This
# cluster builds the LBANN applications and libraries using a single
# compiler toolchain and then runs a collection of tests. Testing
# output is in JUnit format and parsed by the pipeline for web
# viewing.

include:
  - .gitlab/common/env.yml

stages:
  - everything
  - cleanup

# In contrast to the Catalyst pipeline, this will look much
# simpler. There is only one functional stage and there's no fiddling
# around with persistent allocations or anything like that. Plus, it
# reuses some of the bamboo infrastructure (run.sh). On the downside,
# it made me look at run.sh and remind me how badly we need to
# refactor that file. So a little up, a little down.
