# This is the testing pipeline for the Catalyst cluster at LLNL. This
# cluster builds the LBANN applications and libraries using a single
# compiler toolchain and then runs a collection of tests. Testing
# output is in JUnit format and parsed by the pipeline for web
# viewing.

  - .gitlab/common/env.yml

stages:
  - allocate
  - build
  - test
  - deallocate

# The purpose of this job is simply to allocate some nodes for the
# pipeline to utilize. The trick here is JOB_NAME. Later on, we will
# extract the job ID from the SLURM queue using this name. It will be
# unique to this pipeline and therefore shared across all jobs in this
# pipeline.

# This replaces "test_compiler.py". This has the advantage that it
# very explicitly approximates what a user would do to build LBANN.
#
# This job also establishes the Spack environment that we will
# use. We'll use the same environment for the whole pipeline. This
# should be fine as the test jobs will view the environment as
# "read-only".

# The next two jobs effectively replace the rest of "run.sh".
#
# There is a bit of a hack going on here: instead of passing
# "--jobid=${JOB_ID}" to an srun command, we "export
# SLURM_JOB_ID=${JOB_ID}" into the environment prior to launching the
# test script. The reason for this is that the srun commands are
# buried deep inside the Python infrastructure and it would be
# nontrivial to push them all the way in (not so nontrivial that this
# wouldn't be worth doing, but nontrivial enough that it should be its
# own PR).
#
# This appears to be working with one main side effect: as written,
# the integration tests and the unit tests will interfere with each
# other. It's not clear if they are interleaving or overlapping. This
# happens because the two jobs in the test stage will run
# concurrently. We can change this if it's shown to be a problem.

# This is a dummy job that checks the output of the Catch2
# testing. This is one of the gotchas of GitLab: The Catch2 test
# executables are artifacts of the build procedure, but we don't save
# the entire build as artifacts (it would be very large and there's no
# need since the rest of the tests run on the installed targets (for
# better or worse)). For maximum clarity from the web interface, we
# write a file when the Catch tests fail but then return success from
# the script that runs them. This means that the build job will fail
# iff the build fails. This job will be marked as "failed" if any of
# the catch tests failed, and the pytest-based unit/integration tests
# will run any time the build succeeds.
