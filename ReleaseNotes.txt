Integration with Hydrogen, an optimized distributed, dense linear algebra
library.  Hydrogen is a fork of the Elemental library.  Hydrogen optimizes for:
distributed matrices with elemental and block distributions, BLAS, LAPACK,
distributed and local matrix management.

Integration with optimized all-reduce communication library Aluminum.  Aluminum
provides custom reduction patterns, customized CUDA reduction kernels,
and asynchronous communication operators. It uses MPI, MPI w/GPUdirect, or NCCL
as back-end libraries. Aluminum enables us to effectively use non-blocking
all-reduces during backprop/optimization

Additionally, we have added support for an online, distributed data store.  When
enabled, LBANN is able to ingest all of the training data set in a distributed
method across all ranks.  Each data store is then able to serve it's portion of
a mini-batch, dynamically moving data to the necessary ranks in the model (based
on the mini-batch data distribution).

============================== Release Notes: v0.93 ==============================
This release contains a major refactoring / overhaul of the code base.
Key highlights include:
- Moving layer design into smaller simpler layers that have a single
  compute behavior per layer.  Specifically, linear combination of the
  inputs, non-linear activations, and regularizers now exist as their
  own layers.
- Layers now have a template parameter that specifies the data layout
  for the distributed matrices.
- Prototext interface for specifying neural network models and data
  readers is nearly fully functional.
- Code now adheres to internal coding style as outlined in
  README_coding_style.txt
- Dead-code has been eliminated and layer file hierarchy has been
  cleaned up.

============================== Release Notes: v0.92 ==============================
New features include (but are not limited to):
  - Full support for convolutional and pooling layers
  - GPU acceleration of local Elemental GEMM operations
  - Improved network and data reader support
    -- Alexnet
    -- VGG
    -- CIFAR-10
  - Added a suite of regularizers, objective functions, and metrics, including:
    -- Batch normalization
    -- Drop-out
    -- L2
  - Dramatically improves the performance of inter-model communication
  - Added suite of image prepossessing routines

============================== Release Notes: v0.91 ==============================
Incorporates a number of changes through the LBANN code base.  In
particular there is a new build system that tries to have LBANN
download all of the dependencies into its build tree, and compile them
locally.  Additional improvements include optimizations in the data
parallel, multiple model training framework, support for convolutional
layers, and general bug fixes.

============================== Release Notes: v0.90 ==============================
Initial release of the LBANN toolkit.
